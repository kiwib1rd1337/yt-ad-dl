__TODO: Implement  midroll ads
Implement processing of other ad types, including off-site ads.<br>
This should improve the success rate of obtaining ads.<br>
Currently, the script may need to be executed multiple times in order to fetch ads, which is annoying.<br>
Currently, only certain YT-hosted ads are detected.<br>
Ads using different hosting providers, as well as midroll ads, are not currently being detected.<br>
If API requests are needed for this, then we may need to resort to advanced CURL and GREP usage, or some inline python scripting, in order to achieve this...<br>
